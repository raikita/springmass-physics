The cloth itself is 50 by 50 with points a distance of 2 from each other, resulting in a cloth that is able to have many folds. The small distance between the points require a larger timestep however this allows for more smaller folds.

I took an iterative approach into solving for collisions.
For each point, I have set a very small value for maximum distance they are allowed to be close to another point before collision will be detected and calculated. This was determined by having two numbers, one being 0.005 and the other -0.005, because I calculate the distance between two points be minusing their positions, and the number would be negative or positive (or 0) depending on which minuses the other. A small value is chosen to allow the cloth to still be able to create smaller folds. If the result is between the two numbers (this must be true for x and y and z), I have the one point repel itself from the other.
This is a perfectly elastic collision, and I use the law of conservation of momentum and conservation of kinetic energy to calculate it. Because all of the masses are the same (0.5), I use the special case where if m1 = m2, v1 = u2 and v2 = u1 where m1 and m2 are the masses of the points being considered, u1 and u2 are initial velocities and v1 and v2 are the velocities after collision. So therefore, I have the point being calculated inherit the velocity of the point it is colliding into.
